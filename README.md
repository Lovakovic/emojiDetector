### Hi! This is my small Tensorflow project I made using Keras. 

The main goal of the project is to get familiar with Keras API and to gain some knowledge about image classification. 

For now, the first version is completed, however, I do believe
that I will return back to this project later, as I believe expanding and modifying training data, as well as changing
the input format would yield noticeably better results.

Libraries required are listed in `requirements.txt`. If you only want to run the project on CPU, instead of 
`tensorflow-gpu`, you can install regular tensorflow. However, if you wish to run the project on GPU, and you're on 
Windows then install `tensorflow-gpu`.

### To make your life easier, here is a list of requirements that you need to have to run on the Windows:
- CUDA toolkit 11.2
- cuDNN 8.1
